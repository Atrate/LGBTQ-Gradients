This repo contains gradients commonly associated with the LGBTQ+ community for use in GIMP. You can find examples of them being used in [examples](./examples/).

All the flags' colours have been taken from Wikipedia.

## Contributing

Feel free to add additional examples to the [examples](./examples/) directory or create additional gradients, as long as you provide a source for the colour scheme (e.g. Wikipedia).

Please keep in mind that all pull/merge requests should be submitted to the [GitLab repo](https://gitlab.com/Atrate/lgbtq-gradients), since repos on e.g. GitHub are just mirrors.
